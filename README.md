# Diwali Sales Analysis using Python
This analysis is done in order to improve customer experience and ofcourse the sales by finding out the target customers and furthur using target marketing
## Here's what I explored:
* Product popularity: Which product categories emerged as the top sellers during Diwali? ️
* Customer insights: Did demographics like age, gender, or location play a role in purchasing behavior? ‍‍‍
* Sales patterns: Were there any interesting trends in order volume or total sales throughout the festive period?

By analyzing Diwali sales data, I gained valuable insights that could be instrumental for businesses in planning future sales strategies.
